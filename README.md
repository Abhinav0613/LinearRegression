### LinearRegression
### PROJECRT TITLE : Predict the heart attack disase for organsization who are using meachine learning algorithm rate of heart attack disease will increasing manner or decreasing manner
### PROBLEM STATEMENT
A world heard organization estmated 12 million Dead records. One of them half of the dead result is found in US. The rescearch schlor point out the most revelent risk factor of heatattack as a data science engineer predict the overall risk using meachine learning algorithm is called logistic regression
### TASK
1.import the libraries which is the reqired for preduction

2.import the data set using the work space

3.use a appropate argument or sklearn librraries to train,test,and split the data set.

4.fit your value with arrange function using future scalling.

5.check your model accuracyand precussion using confuser matrix

### CONCLUSION
According to the model analysis thre logsticregression algrothim work successfully with 0.6 accuracy done,The accuracy shows that building the model is successful.
